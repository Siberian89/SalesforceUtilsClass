# Salesforce Utls Class

This project was created with the intent of gather utility methods often useful in apex class development, methods usually rebuild from the ground up. Every method has one or more test methods, included in the UtilsTest class, with the aim to reach the 100% coverage.

## What about now?

This was a private project and I was using GitHut to track changes. I decided to go public to share the code but, right now, I will be the only one to modify it.
